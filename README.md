emlbootstrap
============

**Fresh install and update configuration for EML computers.**  

Todo:
- [x] Write SecurityBanner.txt
  - [x] Write Security Banner install script
- [x] Media Lab quartz composer screensaver
  - [x] Install script for the screen saver and enable during login screen
  - [x] Install for all users and set timeouts & lockout
- [x] Disable icloud signin on first login to all accounts.
- [ ] Install customized rsnapshot.conf for 'hazel-ish' cleaning + launchd 
- [ ] Install dockutil script + lauchnd 
- [ ] Don't run defaults.sh, create repo of basic preference plists and just move them into place. Messing
      with defaults write is awful for multiple accounts.
